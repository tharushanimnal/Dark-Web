<h2><b><i>IS IT ILLEGAL TO GO ON THE DARK WEB?</i></b></h2>
<div align="justify"> 
<p class="p">Simply put, no it is not illegal to access the dark web. In fact, some uses are perfectly legal and support the value of the “dark web.” On the dark web, users can seek out three clear benefits from its use:<br>

User anonymityVirtually untraceable services and sitesAbility to take illegal actions for both users and providers.<br><br>

As such, the dark web has attracted many parties who would otherwise be endangered by revealing their identities online. Abuse and persecution victims, whistleblowers, and political dissidents have been frequent users of these hidden sites. But of course, these benefits can be easily extended to those that want to act outside of the constraints of laws in other explicitly illegal ways.<br><br>

When viewed through this lens, the dark web’s legality is based on how you as a user engage with it. You might fall to the wayside of legal lines for many reasons that are important for the protection of freedom. Others may act in ways that are illegal for the protection and safety of others. Let’s unpack both of these concepts in terms of the “dark web browser” and the websites themselves.</p><br><br>

<h2><b><i>IS TOR ILLEGAL TO USE?</i></b></h2>

<p class="p">On the software end, the use of Tor and other anonymized browsers is not strictly illegal. In fact, these supposed “dark web” browsers are not tethered exclusively to this portion of the internet. Many users now leverage Tor to browse both the public Internet and the deeper parts of the web privately.<br><br>

The privacy offered by the Tor browser is important in the current digital age. Corporations and governing bodies alike currently participate in unauthorized surveillance of online activity. Some simply don't want government agencies or even Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to know what they're looking at online, while others have little choice. Users in countries with strict access and user laws are often prevented from accessing even public sites unless they use Tor clients and virtual private networks (VPNs).<br><br>

However, you can still take illegal actions within Tor that could incriminate you regardless of the browser’s legality. You could easily use Tor in an attempt to pirate copyrighted content from the deep web, share illegal pornography, or engage in cyber terrorism. Using a legal browser will not make your actions fall to the right side of the law.</p><br><br>

<h2><b><i>ARE SITES ON THE DARK WEB ILLEGAL TO USE AND VISIT?</i></b></h2>

<p class="p">On the network end, the dark web is a bit more of a grey area. The use of the dark web usually means that you are attempting to engage in activity that you could not otherwise carry out in the public eye.<br><br>

For government critics and other outspoken advocates, they may fear backlash if their real identities were discovered. For those who have endured harm at the hands of others, they may not want their attackers to discover their conversations about the event. If an activity is deemed illegal by the governing bodies you fall under, then it would be illegal.<br><br>

That said, anonymity comes with a dark side since criminals and malicious hackers also prefer to operate in the shadows. For example, cyberattacks and trafficking are activities that the participants know will be incriminating. They take these actions to the dark web to hide for this reason.<br><br>

Ultimately, simply browsing these spaces is not illegal but can be an issue for you. While it is not illegal as a whole, unsavory activity does live in many parts of the dark web. It can expose you to unnecessary risks if you are not careful or an advanced, computer savvy user aware of its threats. So, what is the dark web used for when it’s used for illegal activity?</p>
