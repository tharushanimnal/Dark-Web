<p class="p">Many times the two terms are used interchangeably as if they are more or less the same thing.This is very inaccurate,as the deep web just refers to non-indexed pages,while the dark web refers to pages which are both non-indexed and involved in illegal niches.</p>

<p class="p">This image using an iceberg metaphor should clear it up in an easier to comprehend way.As you can notice,ironically,the dark web is actually deeper than the deep web.</p>

<p class="p"><B>The bottom line is this:</B> the deep web might be made of up of non-indexed pages simply because search engines fail to see them or because they're not deemed relevant enough to be indexed.In contrast,the dark web wants to be hidden,since it's a hub for shady business on purpose.</p>

<p class="p">The deep web is ethically neutral, it can be  used for good or for bad.The dark web is where the parts of moral-lacking economy and society came togethere.</p>

<p class="p">As far as the relationship between them goes,not all deep web is dark web,but all dark web is deep web.</p>
