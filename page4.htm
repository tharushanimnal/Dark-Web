<p class="p">SOME OF THE MOST COMMONLY SEEN DANGERS INCLUDE;</p>

<h3><i><b>Potential Malware.</b></i></h3>

<p class="p"><b>Browsing the dark web puts you at risk of cyberattacks </b>such as DDoS attacks,botnets and other malware or viruses. By simply enterning the wrong 
URL or accidentally downloding a malicious file,you could install infectious viruses or malware.This can have a detrimental impact on your device,or even
worse,expose your personal information.</p>

<p class="p">**To prevet these types of dangers, I recommend browsing the dark web with a direct goal in mind-research specific sites ahead of time and keep a list
of links that you can trust.**</p>

    <h3><i><b>Dangerous Activities.</b></i></h3>

<p class="p"><b>The dark web is the home of many criminal activities-</b> from the use of stolen or fake documents to drug and weapon dealing.What's more,it's a network
that includes assassins for hire,child pornography,and even live streams of murders.<b>if you accidentally and up on one of those pages,you may face legal 
charges,</b>should someone find out.</p>

<p class="p">**To avoid encountering disturbring or illegal situations,i advise against entering darknet sites before thoroughly researching them.i also recommend that you 
browse the dark web with complete anonymity by using a VPN-just to be safe.**</p>

    <h3><b><i>Fraudulent Sites.</i></b></h3>

<p class="p"><b>Hackers on the dark web can easily access your personal data</b> by using trojans,phishing,and other types of fraudulent websites or programs.sometimes all 
it takes is a simple misclick before all of the information stored on your computer gets leaked.Even wores-cybercriminals have been known to activate computer 
cameras and microphones to get lives stream from unsuspecting victims.</p>

    <h3><i><b>Surveillance.</b></i></h3>
<p class="p">In an attempt to stop the criminal organizations operating on the dark web,authorities are setting up fake websites to track possible criminal activiyty.
By doing this,they get access to whoever is visiting the sites-and this includes you if you accidentally end up there. in some parts of the world,simply using a browser 
like tor can get you flagged by these agencies,even if you don't partake in illegal activity.</p>
