<h2><b><i>How to access DARK WEB safely in 2022</i></b></h2>

<p class="p">The dark web is the most controversial and dangerous part of the internet — and it can only be accessed with certain browsers, such as Tor. It’s generally portrayed as a bad place where criminals gather to communicate away from the law. Although that’s partially true, there are also plenty of good reasons for you to access the dark web.</p><br>
    
<p class="p">A major benefit to using the dark web is anonymity. However, this only extends as far as the network — your ISP (for example) can see you’re accessing it and could report it to the authorities, even if you’re not doing anything illegal.<br>

The only way to stay completely anonymous on the Tor network is to use a VPN. This encrypts your internet traffic and reroutes it through its private servers. This hides your personal data from prying eyes, hackers, trackers, and other cyber threats associated with accessing the dark web.</p><br>
    
<p class="p">For the highest level of security, I recommend ExpressVPN. It enforces a strict no-logs policy and uses military-grade encryption to keep you anonymous.</p>
